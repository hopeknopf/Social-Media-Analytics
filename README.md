# Social-Media-Analytics
Coursework for Social Media Analytics class - UT MSBA Spring 2019

This class taught topics such as Network Analysis, Bipartite Networks, Image Analytics, Methods of Measurement for Social Engagment, ROI on Social Media Spend, and more. 

In this repo you will find code for 2 assignments and one project that were completed for this class by myself and 4 other group members collaboratively in which we apply the concepts learned in the class using various methods in Python.   

Assignment 1 - Building a model to predict social influence, find predictors of social influence on Twitter, quantify financial value of social influence, and then use our model to identify top influences from a list of Twitter users.  

Assignment 2 - Scrape the National Geographic Instagram account, use Google Vision to analyze the photos, build a model to predict engagement using both the image content and captions of the Instagram posts, perform LDA topic modeling on the images, and recommend improvements to National Geographic on how to increase engagement on their Instagram account.

Project - We combined methods from both assignments into our term project for the class.  We analyzed content from 10 top Austin food bloggers Instagram accounts and compared the content (using image analytics and topic modeling) to a new Austin food blog - @thedanggoodlife.  We also analyzed the network of bloggers and commonly used hashtags using the NetworkX package in Python and built a model of engagement.  From our analysis, we were able to recommend hashtags to use and content to post to this new Austin food blogger to  help her increase engagement and social influence.
